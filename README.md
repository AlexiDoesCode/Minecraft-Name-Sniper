# Minecraft Name Sniper

A simple asynchronous Minecraft Name Sniper, I don't recommend to use this. Just use [MCsniperPY](http://github.com/MCsniperPY/MCsniperPY) by @Kqzz

## Setup

1. Install the requirements (AIOHttp, asyncio, beautifulsoup4)
```
pip install aiohttp
pip install asyncio
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
2. Run the program
3. It will generate a accounts.txt, put your account in there, format: (email:password:sq1:sq2:sq3)
4. Run the program again.
5. Input the name you want to snipe
6. Input the delay ( Start with something like 400 and try to aim for a .1 receive time stamp)
7. Let it run, it should work, just not as well.

## Disclaimer

This doesn't work that great but it does what it intends to.
Use [MCsniperPY](http://github.com/MCsniperPY/MCsniperPY) by @Kqzz instead.
